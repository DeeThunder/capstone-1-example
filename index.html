            <h4>Industrial Trainee, Bells University of Technology, Ota, Nigeria    Aug 2022 – Oct 2022</h4>
            <p>I took part in the Bells University of Technology’s three-month mandated Student Work Experience Programme (SWEP) in my second year to obtain practical experience in the mechanical, civil, and electrical workshops where lecturers in those disciplines engaged us in the building and innovative processes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the electrical workshop, I was tasked to create circuits to power electrical items like LED bulbs, creating a prototype traffic signal control unit and street light system, while gaining technical knowledge in current conversion processes.</li>
                <li>In the mechanical workshop, I designed metal bins from scratch to promote sustainable waste disposal. Additionally, I crafted a woodwork project, transforming planks into a staff storage shelf through drilling, stripping, and spraying.</li>
                <li>In the civil workshop, I contributed to the production of interlocked tiles, from mixing concrete to laying them on a university walkway. I also observed the construction progress of a new lecture theatre, enhancing the school's aesthetic appeal.</li>
            </ul>
